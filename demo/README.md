to view the damo, open the jupyter notebook, read in the csv files, and use 'voila' tab inside jupyter to launch demo

there is another csv file required for demo, which is too big to upload to github.
--> name of the file is "df_mean_std_missing", it can be downloaded from VM in the directory:  --> cd /data/results/batch_run
